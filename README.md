# Notes-Application-Android
**Notes** is an application which is used to Create, Update and Delete the notes. This application covers all the basic functionalities 
of a note taking app. It is built using the MVVM architecture of android.
A local database is used for this app which stores all the notes. Here we have used the Room Database. 
Room provides an object-relational mapping (ORM) approach, allowing developers to define their app's data model as objects and 
easily interact with the underlying database. It offers a set of annotations that can be applied to data access objects (DAOs), 
entities, and database classes to define the database schema and perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations.
